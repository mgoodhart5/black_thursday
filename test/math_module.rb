# all you really have to get is the Array of numbers of occurences
# in order to calculate the mean. after that, you can have a method where you pass
# those numbers in and IN FACT calculate the mean.
#
# separately after that, you need to take that same Array, minus
# the average from each number, and square that number
# those need to be added together and then divided by the original
# amount of numbers minus one.
